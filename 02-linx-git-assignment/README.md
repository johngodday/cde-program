### Question 1: ETL Pipeline with Bash Scripting

This project implements a **simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using **Bash scripting**.  

The pipeline is designed to:  
1. **Extract** data from a given source.  
2. **Transform** the data into a clean, standardized format.  
3. **Load** the processed data into a target location for further use.  

All configuration values (e.g., file paths, source URLs) are stored in a `.env` file to keep the script flexible and environment-independent.
